codes for poj. all C++ codes.
mebered a lot for solving it, how to define mutli-dim vector, how to define queue, how to define struct array, how to 
poj3984.cpp: my solution for poj 3984. BFS for shortest path, and recursively trace back the path. I remebered a lot for solving it: how to define mutli-dim vector, how to define queue, how to define struct array, how to define direction, how to write BFS, how to trace path. Note, BFS is not implemented recursively itself (in contrast, DFS is usually implemnted in a recursive way).
